# Manix (Max Unix)

> **âš  Warning**<br> Manix is in very early alpha development stages. On top of this, this OS is totally hobby and probably isn't going to be better than any other Unix-based OS for any reason. If you are like me and do just like to check out other people's OS instead of making your own though, be my guest.

## About
**Manix (Max Unix)** is a hobby operating system made by me, Max Prime! I've been using Linux for almost a year (Arch, btw) and I have loved the prospect of OS development maybe since I was 6 or 7. I have always wanted to build and OS like this so I said *"fuck it. I'm older and have more experience(?) so lets give it a crack"*.

-1500 odds that I actually finish this project.
