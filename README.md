# Manix (Max Unix)


> **âš  Warning**<br> Manix is in very early alpha development stages. On top of this, this OS is totally hobby and probably isn't going to be better than any other Unix-based OS for any reason. If you are like me and do just like to check out other people's OS instead of making your own though, be my guest.
